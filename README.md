# BasketballScorecard
Week 2 Assessment - Maven &amp; JUnit
This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of Maven and JUnit. For this project, I created a BasketballScorecard class that represents what an individual player's shooting statistics are. I then created three methods in the ScorecardLogic class that calculates a player's shooting percentage, average points per game, and total points scored. Lastly, I implemented two JUnit test case classes and a JUnit suite class to test my methods from the ScorecardLogic class.
